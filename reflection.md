Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
For the Cafe class, I overloaded the sellCoffee() and restock() methods so that they can take in orders that use to-go cups (thus taking in nCups) and orders that don't (and thus does not take in nCups into the method).
For the Library class I overloaded the constructors to allow for a constructor that only takes in the library name and one that takes in both name and address.
For the House class I overloaded the constructor to have an overloaded contructor with residents so we can put in the list of residents when constructing the house. I also overloaded the moveOut method to allow for it to take in the name of a resident to remove but also take in the index of the resident on the residents ArrayList instead.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I quite liked this assignment as the instructions were very clear and there was room for creativity since there was no right answer and we could choose what methods or constructors to overload. I found using javadocs for ArrayLists and HashTables very useful.
